DotPop - v1.2
Created by Johnnoz

----Instructions----
Place the DotPop_v1_2 folder in beatoraja's "skin/" folder, all 4 resolution
variants of the skin should show under 9keys.
Pick the skin variant for the resolution you plan to be using, and feel free to
delete the "play9-XXXX.luaskin" files and "graphics/XXXX" folders for the sizes
you're not using.

----Changelog----
1.2:
-Added a new slim graph option, takes up more vertical space but less horizontal and is closer to the lanes. Only avaliable on the right side for now.
-Fixed some BGA videos not playing correctly, and polished the bga windows in general.
-Fixed messed up HCN and mine graphics.
-Extra info text boxes now don't display if there's no info to actaully put in them.
-Updated the style of some of the frame graphics, I think it looks better but yell at me if you disagree.
-Fixed lanecovers being busted, again.
-Added a loading bar.

1.1: 
-Added missing sudden cover support.

----Blah----
I wanted an arcade style 9 key skin, but also wanted it to look good at 1440p.
But skins native to 1440 are gonna look awful at the 1080p most people will use,
so what's the solution? Save an entirely separate set of graphics for 1080, 1440
and throw 720 and 4k in there too!
